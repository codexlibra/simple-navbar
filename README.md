## Getting Started
A simple navbar made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It works on screen widths of 992px and above (that's why it's simple), I should be working on making it responsive right now!

### How it works
Hovering over the drop-down item shows the submenu and hovering over the submenu shows the other submenu, which is placed on the left or right side depending on whether there is enough space in the width of the screen, as shown in the image:

## Add a logo
You can add an icon or logo in the navbar brand instead of text.

```html
<a href="#">
  <img src="[your/logo/path]" class="brand-icon" alt=" ">
</a>
```
